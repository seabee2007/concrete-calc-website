        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and approving all outputs before using them
          for bids, contracts, schedules, purchases, construction activities, safety planning, tax filings,
          accounting records, client communications, or business decisions.

        </p>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that all estimating outputs are dependent on the information entered,
          selected, imported, or configured by you or your users. Actual project costs, labor productivity,
          material quantities, crew performance, equipment usage, weather conditions, site conditions,
          subcontractor pricing, supplier pricing, permit requirements, inspection requirements, and market
          conditions may differ significantly from software-generated estimates.
        </p>
        <p>Arden Project OS does not guarantee:</p>
        <ul className={LEGAL_MODAL_LIST}>

          <li>Compliance with any contract requirement</li>
        </ul>

          You are responsible for independently validating all estimates before submitting proposals, bids,
          invoices, schedules, or contracts.

          calculations, Level III Gantt charts, crew demand charts, float calculations, and related planning
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scheduling outputs depend on user-entered durations, logic links, crew assumptions, activity
          selections, calendars, constraints, and project data. Arden Project OS does not guarantee that a
          generated schedule is feasible, contract-compliant, resource-loaded, risk-adjusted, or suitable for
          submission to an owner, general contractor, government entity, or any other party.

        <p>
          You are solely responsible for reviewing all proposal content before sending it to any client,
          owner, contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or third party. This includes reviewing pricing, scope
          of work, exclusions, assumptions, dates, client information, business information, terms, taxes,

        <p>
          Shared links, proposal links, client portal links, or public tokens may allow third parties to view

        <p>Please review this section carefully. It may affect your legal rights.</p>
        <p>
          Before filing a claim, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally.
          You must send a written notice describing the dispute, the relief requested, and your contact
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days, either party may pursue binding arbitration as
          described below, unless an exception applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be
          resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that either
          party may bring an individual claim in small claims court if eligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and Arden Project OS waive any right to a jury trial and waive any right to participate in a class
          action, class arbitration, collective action, private attorney general action, or representative
          proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration will be administered by a reputable arbitration provider selected by us, unless the
          parties agree otherwise. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator may award the
          same individual relief that a court could award, but only for the individual claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          This arbitration section does not prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief
          for misuse of intellectual property, unauthorized access, confidentiality violations, or security
          abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending written notice within 30 days after first
          accepting these Terms. Your opt-out notice must include your name, account email, and a statement
          that you opt out of arbitration.
        </p>
        <p>If this arbitration section is found unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms will remain in effect.</p>
